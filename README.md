# FAQ
**Q**: Why did you create a selfbot?
**A**: This bot was created as some sort of an "experiment" at first, but I decided to turn this into a general purpose bot.

**Q:** Are selfbots allowed on Revolt?
**A:** Selfbots have been allowed on the platform ever since it was created. And they even mention selfbots in the official documentation. Although some servers may not allow selfbots. So it's generally not recommended to use selfbots on servers that don't allow it, or just don't use selfbots for malicious intent such as mass mentioning, sending bulk friend requests, and spamming.

**Q:** Where did you get the name "Ayana" from?
**A:** That name just randomly popped out my head. It's a pretty cool female name imo.

**Q:** Why is the repo and the internal codebase named "dapdap" then?
**A:** This bot used to be named dapdap, the nickname of my former best friend. But due to personal reasons, and when our friendship ended, I was forced to rename the bot to prevent any further damage.
